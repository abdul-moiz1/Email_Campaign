isting Admin Dashboard that shows businesses and generated emails with the following features:

1. Handle “duplicate” response from the webhook

I already call a Make.com webhook when I scrape or save a business. The webhook response can contain something like:

{ "status": "saved" } for new records

{ "status": "exists" } when the business is already in Firestore (duplicate)

Change my admin frontend so that:

After the webhook call finishes, check response.status.

If response.status === "exists":

Show a small popup / toast at the top-right:

Text: "This business already exists in the database."

Also show a small badge or text on the related card:

"Already exists" (use a neutral or warning color)

If response.status === "saved":

Show a popup / toast:

"Business saved successfully."

Make sure the popup disappears after a few seconds or when the user closes it.

Keep the existing styling consistent with the current admin UI (same fonts, colors, and corner radius).

2. Add “Mark as sent” to generated emails

I have a generatedEmails collection in Firestore. Each email document has at least:

campaignId (or placeId tying it to the business)

businessName

businessEmail

subject

body

status (e.g. "generated", "edited", "sent")

createdAt

updatedAt (optional)

sentAt (optional)

On the Admin page, for each business that already has a generated email:

Show:

Business name

Business email

Current email status (badge): "Generated", "Edited", or "Sent" based on the status field.

A “View / Edit Email” button that opens the subject/body in a modal or panel (this may already exist; keep it).

Inside that email modal/panel, add a “Mark as sent” button.

Behaviour:

Only show “Mark as sent” if status is not already "sent".

When clicked:

Update the corresponding generatedEmails document in Firestore:

status = "sent"

sentAt = current timestamp

After successful update:

Update the UI state so the status badge shows "Sent".

Disable or hide the “Mark as sent” button.

Show a small confirmation toast: "Email marked as sent."

If status === "sent":

Show a green “Sent” badge on the card.

Do not allow editing the status back from the UI (view only).

Keep the email body still viewable, but “Mark as sent” should be disabled or hidden.

3. General UI rules

Do not break existing routing or Firestore queries.

Reuse my existing Firebase config.

Keep all components in the same style as the current admin page (no new design system).

Handle loading and error states on:

Webhook calls

Firestore updates for status / sentAt

In short:

Show a clear "Already exists" message when Make/Firestore says the business is duplicate.

Add a proper “Mark as sent” flow that updates Firestore and the UI for generated emails.
